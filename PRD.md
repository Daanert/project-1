## 6. UI/UX Design Considerations

- **Layout and Navigation:**
  - Clean and responsive design with no specific branding constraints.
  - Intuitive navigation from file upload to preview and download.
  
- **File Upload Component:**
  - Supports both drag-and-drop and traditional file picker methods.
  - Displays validation messages and upload progress.

- **Thumbnail Gallery:**
  - Displays PDF thumbnails with two overlay elements:
    - Page count at the lower left.
    - Magnifying glass icon at the upper left for preview.
  
- **Detailed Preview Modal:**
  - Enlarged view of PDF pages with smooth scrolling.
  - Metadata displayed alongside the preview (date, file size, etc.).

- **Download Controls:**
  - Clearly labeled buttons for "Download Selected" and "Download All" (ZIP archive).

## 7. Technical Architecture

### 7.1 Front-End
- **Framework:**  
  - Use a modern JavaScript framework (React, Angular, or Vue) to build a Single Page Application (SPA).
- **Components:**
  - **Upload Component:**  
    - Manages file picker and drag-and-drop functionality.
    - Provides visual feedback during file uploads.
  - **Thumbnail Gallery:**  
    - Renders generated PDF thumbnails with overlay elements.
  - **Preview Modal:**  
    - Displays a larger, interactive PDF preview with scrolling and metadata.
  - **Download Controls:**  
    - Provides buttons to download selected files or all files as a ZIP archive.

### 7.2 Back-End (Python)
- **Server Environment:**  
  - Build the back end using Python with frameworks such as Flask or Django.
- **RESTful API:**  
  - Endpoints to handle:
    - File uploads.
    - Conversion processing.
    - Thumbnail generation.
    - Download requests.
- **Conversion Module:**

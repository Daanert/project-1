# To-Do List for MSG to PDF Converter App

This to-do list outlines the step-by-step tasks needed to build the app from start to finish.

---

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Planning

- **Project Kickoff**
  - Create a repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
  - Define the technology stack:
    - **Front-End:** React (or Angular/Vue)
    - **Back-End:** Python (using Flask or Django)
- **Review Documentation**
  - Review the PRD to ensure all requirements are clearly understood.
  - Finalize any open questions with stakeholders (if applicable).

---

## Phase 2: Back-End Development (Python)

- **Environment Setup**
  - Create a Python virtual environment.
  - Install required packages:
    - Flask or Django
    - File handling libraries
    - PDF generation libraries (e.g., pdfkit, reportlab, etc.)
    - Libraries for handling `.msg` files and attachments (research and choose the best option)
    - Libraries for ZIP archive creation (e.g., `zipfile`)
- **API Design & Implementation**
  - **File Upload Endpoint**
    - Implement endpoint to accept multiple `.msg` file uploads.
    - Validate file type (`.msg`) and file size (ensure high limits).
    - Save files temporarily on the server.
  - **Conversion Endpoint**
    - Implement conversion logic to convert `.msg` files to PDFs.
    - Ensure that attachments and additional content are included.
    - Save converted PDFs to temporary storage.
  - **Thumbnail Generation Endpoint**
    - Generate a thumbnail of the first page of each PDF.
    - Overlay the page count (lower left) and magnifying glass icon (upper left) on the thumbnail.
  - **Download Endpoints**
    - Endpoint to download selected PDF files.
    - Endpoint to bundle all converted PDFs into a ZIP archive for download.
- **Security & Performance**
  - Validate and sanitize all file inputs.
  - Implement HTTPS for secure data transmission (or prepare for HTTPS on deployment).
  - Add error handling and rate limiting.
- **Testing**
  - Write unit tests for each API endpoint.
  - Validate file uploads, conversion accuracy, thumbnail generation, and download functionality.

## Phase 3: Front-End Development

- **Environment Setup**
  - Initialize a React project (using Create React App or similar).
  - Set up project structure (components, assets, services).
- **Implement File Upload Component**
  - Support both drag-and-drop and file picker.
  - Display validation messages and upload progress.
  - Integrate with back-end API for file uploads.
- **Build Thumbnail Gallery Component**
  - Display thumbnails for each converted PDF.
  - Overlay the page count (lower left) and the magnifying glass icon (upper left).
- **Develop Detailed Preview Modal**
  - Create a modal component that:
    - Shows a larger, scrollable preview of the PDF.
    - Displays metadata (original file date, file size, etc.).
  - Enable the modal to open when the magnifying glass icon is clicked.
- **File Selection & Download Controls**
  - Allow users to select/deselect PDF thumbnails with visual feedback.
  - Implement "Download Selected" button that triggers the download of selected files.
  - Implement "Download All" button to bundle all PDFs into a ZIP archive and trigger download.
- **Integration with Back-End**
  - Connect the front-end components with the respective back-end API endpoints.
  - Ensure proper error handling and user feedback during the process.
- **UI/UX Testing**
  - Test the UI on various devices and browsers.
  - Refine design based on user feedback (no specific branding required).

---

## Phase 4: Integration, Testing & Deployment

- **Integration Testing**
  - Conduct end-to-end testing from file upload through conversion, preview, and download.
- **Performance Testing**
  - Test with high file sizes and multiple simultaneous uploads.
- **Security Testing**
  - Validate that all security measures (input validation, HTTPS, etc.) are effective.
- **Deployment**
  - Deploy the back-end (Python app) on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure).
  - Deploy the front-end on a static hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).
  - Configure the domain and HTTPS.
- **Documentation**
  - Update README.md with setup instructions, API documentation, and user guides.
  - Create deployment and troubleshooting guides.

---

## Phase 5: Post-Deployment & Future Enhancements

- **User Feedback & Monitoring**
  - Set up a mechanism for user feedback (contact form, surveys).
  - Monitor app performance and error logs.
- **Bug Fixes & Iteration**
  - Track issues using an issue tracker.
  - Plan for iterative improvements based on user feedback.
- **Future Features**
  - Consider user authentication and file history.
  - Explore advanced conversion settings or customization options.
  - Integrate analytics for user behavior and conversion performance.
